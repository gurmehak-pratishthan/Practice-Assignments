Task 1 (Beginner â€“ Writing & Reading a File)
Create a program that:
Creates a file called notes.txt.
Writes the text "Hello, Node.js FS!" into it.
Reads the content back from the file.
Prints the content to the console.
ðŸ‘‰ Try this using fs.writeFileSync and fs.readFileSync (synchronous version).

Task 2 (Beginner â€“ Appending & Reading Async)
Create a program that:
Appends the text " Learning Node.js is fun!" to the file notes.txt.
Reads the updated content of the file.
Prints it to the console.
ðŸ‘‰ This time, use the asynchronous versions:
fs.appendFile
fs.readFile

ask 3 (Intermediate â€“ Rename & Delete)
Create a program that:
Renames notes.txt â†’ myNotes.txt.
Reads the file to confirm the rename worked.
Deletes myNotes.txt.
After deletion, try reading it again and handle the error gracefully (print something like "File not found" instead of crashing).
ðŸ‘‰ Use:
fs.rename
fs.unlink
Proper error handling with err checks.
